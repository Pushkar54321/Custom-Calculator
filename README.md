ðŸ§® Custom Calculator with Exception Handling in Java

This project is a custom calculator built in Java that demonstrates the use of user-defined exceptions along with basic arithmetic operations.

âœ¨ Features

Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).

Custom exceptions to handle invalid or restricted inputs:

InvalidInputException â†’ Triggered when an unsupported operator is entered.

CannotDivideBy0Exception â†’ Prevents division by zero.

MaxInputException â†’ Restricts inputs larger than 100000.

MaxMultiplierReachedException â†’ Prevents multiplication if inputs exceed 7000.

Provides user-friendly error messages for better clarity.

ðŸ›  How It Works

The user is prompted to enter two numbers.

The user selects the operation (+, -, *, /).

The calculator checks inputs and applies custom exception handling if rules are violated.

The result (or exception message) is displayed to the user.
